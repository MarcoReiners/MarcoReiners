## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a 4rth year Software Engineering student at Belgium Campus iTversity, passionate about solving real word problems by planning, designing, and building intelligent software solutions and practical, real-world applications. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and developing scalable systems.

From backend systems, intellegent machine learning solutions, database architecture and REST API's to full-stack web applications and deplployment, I enjoy it all.

I hold myself to high standards and believe in finishing what I start. Persistence, discipline, and continuous improvement guide how I approach every project.

I am particularly interested in:
- Scalable Backend systems
- Machine learning and AI systems
- Databases
- Full-stack development
